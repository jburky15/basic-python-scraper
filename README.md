# basic-python-scraper
A web scraper I built using Beautiful Soup 4 as well the Python Requests module. 

Currently it only searches Newegg.com for PC parts, however I am planning to expand it with some other sites in the future. I have been playing around with Python for a few years now but never too seriously. This was more of a project I wanted to build to explore how powerful a tool like this could be. I had a lot of fun making it and am going to be exploring more with Python.
